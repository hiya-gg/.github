**Introducing Hiya**, a social platform to help your followers and fans find more places and ways to support you.
Discoverability is a **huge** issue in the industry, and we're working to eliminate the clutter, cut the BS, and help connect people, together.

**Open Source**

Projects we believe are in a ready state to be open source are listed below.
Any contribution means a lot to us!

* [Landing Page](https://github.com/hiya-gg/landing) - Our kick-ass landing page while our "professional dev team" is hard at work.
* [Backend](https://github.com/hiya-gg/backend) - The central backend API, handling accounts, connections, and other data.

**Closed Source**

Though most of our projects are open source, we go through an initial development phase to get the ball rolling when working on new components.
These are kept momentarily closed source until we're ready to release them.

* Nothing to see here... *yet* ðŸ˜‰
